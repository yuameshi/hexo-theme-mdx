# Getting Started
## Step 1: Install MDx
```bash
# use npm(recommended) or yarn
$ npm install hexo-theme-mdx --save
# or use git clone or git submodule (not recommended)
# You can remove '-b' to get the latest development version(Unstable)
# To get the full commit history of the repository, remove '--depth 1'
$ git clone https://github.com/Yuameshi/hexo-theme-mdx.git themes/mdx -b <版本号> --depth 1
# If you executed the previous command, then this command does not need to be executed
$ git submodule add https://github.com/Yuameshi/hexo-theme-mdx.git themes/mdx
```
## Step 2: Enable MDx
You can use the Hexo command to change the theme to MDx
```bash
hexo config theme mdx
```
You can also modify `_config.yml` directly
```diff yaml
- theme: previous theme
+ theme: mdx
```

# Configuration

## Step1: Download configuration file

```bash
# Bash
$ wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Yuameshi/hexo-theme-mdx@main/_config.yml -O _config.mdx.yml
```
```powershell
# PowerShell
(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("wget https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Yuameshi/hexo-theme-mdx@main/_config.yml", "_config.mdx.yml")
```
or copy contents below to `_config.mdx.yml`

WARNING: If you installed the theme via git, you should delete `_config.yml` in the theme directory.

## Step2: Edit configuration file to your needs
